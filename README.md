muc's 2020 code

thanks to the contribution of all team members!

ECO algorithm was forked from https://github.com/rockkingjy/OpenTracker

building your own `.so` file recommended.

changed the encoding of some files 

and recovered some comments which are lost because of encoding problems when coding (maybe useless?)

# usage

put your video in`./video` and rename it as `1.mp4`

or you should change the file at `others/include/Video_Input.h` .

and then ...

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
../bin/findblue
```
